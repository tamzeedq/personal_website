## Portfolio Website

This is my personal portfolio website created with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and it hosted using [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). You can view the website now at https://tamzeedq.netlify.app/. On the website you can find a summary of my projects, my resume, and links to my socials and email.
